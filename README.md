# About This Repository

This Repository contains some Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. Algorithms are not written in any learning libraries. 

The goal of this Repository is increasing the number of algorthms and adding them Mathematical, Statistical, intuitive etc. Optimizations.

## Usage

Change the code in main.py file:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/safak/Desktop/PerceptronClassifier')
```
  with your path.

## Current Algorithms

⋅⋅* Multiple Linear Regression

⋅⋅* Perceptron Classifier
