# About This Repository

This Repository contains some Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. Algorithms are not written in any learning libraries. 

The goal of this Repository is increasing the number of algorthms; adding them Mathematical, Statistical, intuitive etc. Optimizations and showing the mathematical modelings for the lecture of mine at Yıldız Technical University that is "Introduction to Machine Learning".

## Usage

Change the code in main.py with your path.

Example:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/safak/Desktop/PerceptronClassifier')
```
to
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/where-is-downloaded-file')
```
